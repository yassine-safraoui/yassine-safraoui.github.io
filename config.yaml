          During my 6-month internship at Qorvo, I designed and implemented two key systems to improve debugging and failure monitoring for the QM35 Ultra-Wideband (UWB) chip integrated into Android devices:
            - **High-Performance UCI Packet Logger**: Replaced the existing logcat-based logging with a PCAPNG-based solution compatible with Wireshark, achieving 10–20× faster logging (up to 80× in some cases).
            - **Configurable Error Monitoring System**: Developed a macro-based detection engine capable of identifying failure scenarios in real time, dynamically configurable via Protocol Buffers, and generating detailed debug reports.
